Proof of Concept for VIPER Swift

## What is VIPER?
VIPER is an application of Clean Architecture to iOS apps.
The word VIPER is a backronym for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Routing.
Clean Architecture divides an appâ€™s logical structure into distinct layers of responsibility.
This makes it easier to isolate dependencies (e.g. your database) and to test the interactions at the boundaries between layers. [source](https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/)
